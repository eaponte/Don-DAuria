                            Don D'Auria is responsible for advancing the successful careers of some of the best authors in the field today.  He knows his stuff backwards and forwards - what makes the best work tick and what doesn't work at all, and isn't afraid to say so.  Beyond that, he was a pleasure to work with.  I'd do it again without a moment's hesitation.

He helps you see the places in your story that can be better, and then helps you get it there. Working with him was a delight.

Together, we produced four mystery thrillers. Don exceeds expectations. His attention to detail was profound. His enthusiasm, abundant. He sees beyond detail to nuance. Were I to hire an editor tomorrow, Don would be my first choice.

He can always pinpoint the holes in a tale and help find elegant ways out of them to make the story stronger. There's nobody I'd trust with my manuscript and a red pen more than Don!
